http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones Process

The tidied data set is contained within the file tidydata.txt. It represents the mean and standard deviation of the observations from the original dataset.

The dimension of the table are 

180 rows resulting from 30 test subjects during 6 tested activities.
column structure

    col 1: subject id
        value range 1 .. 30
    col 2: activity label
        value range LAYING SITTING STANDING WALKING WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    col 3 ... col 68: original measurements aggregated as
        either the mean value of the measured means
        or the mean value of the measured standard deviations

These are the original names for the description.
